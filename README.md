Introduction:

The objective of this project is to create a web-based portal that will facilitate the process of training and placement for students, alumni, and companies. The portal will have three databases: student, company, and alumni. The portal will allow students to view and update their personal information, as well as search for jobs that meet their requirements. Companies will be able to post job openings while alumni will be able to network . The portal will generate trends and match constraints to show eligible jobs for students, and will also provide companies with insights into the skills and interests of potential employees. 

Student Database:

The student database will store the personal information of current students, including their name, email address, phone number,branch, area of interest, and graduation date. Students will be able to view and update their personal information using the portal.The students will also be able to view all jobs and the ones they are eligible for depending on their interest among with company's prerequisites. The student database will also store information about their academic performance, including their GPA, courses taken. 

Company Database:
The company database will store information about companies that are interested in recruiting students for job openings. Companies will be able to create a profile that includes their name, job sector, location, and contact information. They will also be able to post job openings on the portal, which will include details such as job title, job description, required skills, and salary range.

Alumni Database:
The alumni database will store information about alumni. Alumni will be able to create a profile that includes their name, email address, phone number, and current job title. They will also be able to provide information about their experience(current job, sector, salary, position,location,tenure). Additionally they will be able to view and update their profile based on their current job role. This will help college connect with more companies and inturn increase the opportunities for existing students. 

Matching Algorithm:
The portal will use a matching algorithm to match students with job openings that meet their requirements. The algorithm will take into account the student's major, GPA, courses taken, as well as the requirements of the job opening, such as the required skills and salary range. The portal will generate a list of eligible job openings for each student, which they can then apply for. 

Trends and Insights:
The portal will generate trends and insights based on the data in the student, company, and alumni databases. This will allow companies to gain insights into the skills and interests of potential employees, and will help students to understand the job market and the skills that are in demand. The portal will also provide information about average salary ranges for different job titles.

Conclusion:
The portal for training and placement site will provide a comprehensive platform for students, alumni, and companies to connect and network. The portal will store information about students, companies, and alumni in separate databases, and will use a matching algorithm to match students with job openings that meet their requirements. The portal will also generate trends and insights based on the data in the databases, which will help students and companies to make informed decisions about their career and hiring strategies. The portal will be a valuable resource for students, alumni, and companies and will help to facilitate the process of training and placement.
